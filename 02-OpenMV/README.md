# How To Run Gen3Car 'Cyclops' (OpenMV Car)

## 1. Intro to control algorithms

Note: The same concepts apply to controlling anything, not just cars: Robots, airplanes, etc
PID was invented by a US Navy sailor tasked with autonomously steering boats. He derived the P, I and D terms by watching helmsman steer boats. His 1922 system was better than the sailors, but was not implemented due to resistance from sailors.

## 2. Install the latest OpenMV IDE
2.1. Link: https://openmv.io/pages/download 

## 3. Grab the code from GitHub and open it in the OpenMV IDE 
3.1. Go to https://github.com/Sashulik/Detroit-Autonomous-Vehicle-Group/tree/master/02-OpenMV <br />
3.2. Download the latest .py file <br /> 
3.3. Open the downloaded file in OpenMV IDE

## 4. Run the code on the car
4.1. Run it on the car (Ask someone for a quick how to if have trouble) <br />
4.2. Modify the PID (look for !!! in the code) <br />
4.3. Run it and see how it goes <br />
4.4. Modify the code by the !!! to make it fail <br />
4.5. Modify the code so it succeeds but is different the the original values

## 5. Get the car to follow a different color line (see if can figure it out on your own or ask)

## 6. Optimize for faster lap time
6.1. Switch to inside color <br />
6.2. Increase car speed <br />
6.3. Tune the PID
